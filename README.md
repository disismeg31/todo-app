## TODO app React

This is a TODO app built using React, leveraging Context API and localStorage for state management and data persistence.

### Main Concepts

- **Conditional Rendering**: Display different UI elements based on the application's state.
- **Destructuring**: Extract values from arrays or objects into distinct variables.
- **Functional Programming**: Utilize methods like `map`, `filter`, and `find` to handle data.
- **useContext**: Manage global state across the application.
- **useState**: Handle component-level state.
- **useEffect**: Manage side effects such as data fetching and subscriptions.

### UI

- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
- **React Icons**: For adding icons to the UI.

### Other Packages

- **uuid**: For generating unique IDs for tasks.
